infrastructure and cookies. A rough estimate of event cost is 3500€. If you want
to support this initiative, we accept donations. Donations are accepted before,
during or even after the event. Though we prefer before. If bigger than targeted
amount is collected before the event, we'll build better infrastructure. Bank
